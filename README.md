# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to uncover trends.
## Project Purpose
This project focused on analyzing various Kickstarter fundraising outcomes compared to their funding goals and launch dates.

## Analysis
The client, Louise, provided a dataset for us to begin work with in a .xlsx file format. The client would like to know how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and funding goals. To do this we had to complete a series of actions manipulating the datasheet provided. We modified the spreadsheet in a variety of ways including creating columns to separate fundraising subcategories form parent categories, changing timestamp information into a date format, and pulling each year the fund raising events occured. 

Here is an example of the dataset Louise provided:

We created a chart based on the dataset given (chart below) that allows us to draw conclusions on when the best time would be for launching a campaign. Looking at the successful and failed lines we can see that from February through may we have Not only the lowest amount of failed fund raising events, but also the highest amount of successful ones.

We then created a chart based on on percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns according to their dollar amount. Here we can see that that as the dollar amount increased the chance for success decreases. When the amounts of money gets too large we can see the eratic movement of the lines due to too little data.

## Challenges, Limitations, Recommendations
There were several challenges in overcoming this project with the single hardest one being my ineptitude when it comes to excel. We also have no idea if this data is legitimate because we were not given a source in which to verify it. I recommend add new graphs and analysis once the dataset has been updated to our current date.
